This is a keylogger I created for Windows using the Windows keyhook method. 
I undertook this project to deepen my understanding of the Windows API libraries and to begin experimenting with security projects.
It goes without saying that I did this for educational purposes and not for any malicious uses. 
If you choose to use this project for any unethical actions, you are solely responsible for them.
